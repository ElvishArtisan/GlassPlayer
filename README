GlassPlayer is a minimalist audio stream player for IceCast and Shoutcast
streaming servers as well as HLS streams. It supports the following audio
output types:

  Advanced Linux Sound Architeture (ALSA)
  File Streaming (FILE)
  JACK Audio Connection Kit (JACK)
  Standard Output (STDOUT)
  Windows Multimedia Extensions (MME)

The base GlassPlayer component utilizes no configuration files or
GUI interface whatsoever; with the 'user interface' consisting entirely of
the command-line invocation.  As such, it is well suited for use cases where
the player is completely driven by an external system or script.

The following audio codecs are supported:

   OggOpus
   OggVorbis
   MPEG-1/2 Layer 2 ('MP2')
   MPEG-1/2 Layer 3 ('MP3')
   MPEG-4 Advanced Audio Coding, High Efficiency Profile ('HE-AAC+')

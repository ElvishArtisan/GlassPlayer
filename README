GlassPlayer is a minimalist audio stream player for IceCast and Shoutcast
streaming servers as well as HTTP Live Streaming (HLS). It supports the
following audio destinations:

  Advanced Linux Sound Architeture (ALSA)
  AudioScience HPI (ASIHPI)
  File Streaming (FILE)
  JACK Audio Connection Kit (JACK)

The base GlassPlayer component utilizes no configuration files or
GUI interface whatsoever; with the 'user interface' consisting entirely of
the command-line invocation.  As such, it is well suited for use cases where
the player is completely driven by an external system or script.

The following audio codecs are supported:

   MPEG-1/1.5 Layer 2 ('MP2')
   MPEG-1/1.5 Layer 3 ('MP3')
   MPEG-2 Advanced Audio Coding, Main Profile ('AAC')
   MPEG-4 Advanced Audio Coding, High Efficiency Profile ('HE-AAC+')
   Ogg Vorbis
